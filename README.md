# Silent Scalper Project
A serverless pipeline for processing files, using AWS and Terraform.

## Features
- Serverless Architecture: Fully leverages AWS's serverless capabilities, ensuring high scalability and cost-efficiency.
- File Validation: Automatically validates incoming files for integrity and correctness.
- Quarantine System: Moves invalid or failed files to a quarantine bucket for further review.
- CloudWatch Monitoring: Centralized logging and performance monitoring for Lambda functions and pipeline activity.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Uses Terraform to define, deploy, and manage the entire infrastructure.
- Scalable and Secure Design: Follows AWS best practices for security and scalability, including permissions and data encryption.

Overview
Silent Scalper is an innovative serverless pipeline designed to streamline the processing of file uploads in a secure and scalable manner. This solution leverages AWS services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch to ensure efficient validation, monitoring, and quarantining of invalid files. With infrastructure as code managed through Terraform, Silent Scalper simplifies deployment, configuration, and maintenance, making it an ideal solution for cloud engineers and organizations seeking fully automated cloud-native systems.

Architecture
Silent Scalper’s architecture includes the following components:

S3 Buckets:
Input Bucket: Receives file uploads.
Output Bucket: Stores successfully processed files.
Quarantine Bucket: Holds invalid files for further review.

AWS Lambda Functions:
File Processor: Validates files and routes them based on validation status.

DynamoDB:
Maintains a record of processed files, including their validation status and metadata.

API Gateway:
Provides a RESTful API for triggering manual processing or querying file statuses.

Amazon CloudWatch:
Logs: Captures detailed execution logs from all Lambda functions, including errors, warnings, and validation outcomes.
Metrics: Tracks key performance indicators like Lambda invocation counts, durations, and error rates.
Alarms: Configured to notify you of anomalies, such as high error rates or prolonged processing durations.

Terraform Modules:
Modular Terraform configurations manage the entire infrastructure, enabling consistency and scalability.

Monitoring and Logging
CloudWatch is integral to the pipeline’s functionality, ensuring visibility and traceability for operations. Here’s how it’s implemented:

CloudWatch Logs:
Lambda functions write detailed logs, including file validation results, errors, and processing metadata.
Logs enable troubleshooting and compliance audits by providing full traceability of pipeline activities.

CloudWatch Metrics:
Tracks Lambda execution details, including:
Invocation count
Duration of processing
Error rates
Custom metrics provide insights into validation trends, such as the ratio of valid to invalid files.

CloudWatch Alarms:
Alerts can notify you of issues such as:
High error rates
Increased processing delays
These alarms allow quick resolution to ensure system reliability.

Prerequisites
Before deploying Silent Scalper, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

Terraform: Version 1.x or later.
AWS CLI: Installed and configured with appropriate IAM credentials.
Python (optional): For customizing Lambda functions or additional processing logic.

Usage
To use the pipeline:

File Upload:
Upload files to the S3 input bucket.

Processing:
Lambda automatically processes the files, validates their contents, and routes them:
Valid files: Sent to the output bucket.
Invalid files: Sent to the quarantine bucket.

Monitoring:
Use CloudWatch to monitor logs, metrics, and alarms for real-time insights into processing activity.
